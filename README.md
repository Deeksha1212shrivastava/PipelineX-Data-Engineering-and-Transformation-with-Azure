PipelineX: Data Engineering and Transformation with Azure

Project Overview
In this project, I developed an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on Azure Databricks to process and transform data. By leveraging the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) along with Delta Lake, the pipeline efficiently ingests, cleans, and aggregates large datasets, ensuring high-quality, structured data that is ready for advanced analytics.

Additionally, I integrated several Azure services, such as Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Synapse Analytics, and IAM (Identity and Access Management) to enhance security, governance, and performance throughout the pipeline.

Pipeline Overview
1. Raw Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
Utilized Azure Data Factory to dynamically load raw data (CSV/Parquet) into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2).
Configured a dynamic pipeline to handle varying data conditions, ensuring efficient ingestion based on file size, frequency, and activity.

2. Data Transformation (Silver Layer)
Processed data in Azure Databricks using PySpark to clean, transform, and enrich raw datasets.
Key transformations included:
Adding derived columns, such as order_date and product.
Applying data quality checks to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
Integrated Microsoft Entra ID for secure identity and access management, ensuring proper authorization across services.
Used IAM services to manage roles, permissions, and data access security across all layers.
Transformed data was then written back to ADLS Gen2 in Parquet format for further aggregation.

3. Data Aggregation & Final Processing (Gold Layer)
Stored aggregated and optimized data in Delta Lake format, ensuring transactional consistency and enabling time travel for historical analysis.
Created external tables for key datasets (e.g., source_gold, source_parquet, gold.extsales) and used SQL in Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient querying.
Integrated Synapse Analytics in the Gold Layer for high-performance querying and advanced analytics at scale.
Enabled schema evolution in Delta Lake to seamlessly handle changes in the incoming data structure, ensuring flexibility in data processing.
Leveraged IAM and Synapse's security features to manage access control for sensitive data in the Gold Layer, ensuring secure and compliant access.
